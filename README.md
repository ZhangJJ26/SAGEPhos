# SAGEPHOS: SAGE BIO-COUPLED AND AUGMENTED FUSION FOR PHOSPHORYLATION SITE DETECTION
This repository contains the open-source implementation of the paper "SAGEPHOS: SAGE BIO-COUPLED AND AUGMENTED FUSION FOR PHOSPHORYLATION SITE DETECTION". SAGEPhos introduces a Bio-Coupled Modal Fusion method, distilling essential kinase sequence information to refine task-oriented local substrate feature space, creating a shared semantic space that captures crucial kinase-substrate interaction patterns. Within the substrateâ€™s intra-modality domain, it focuses on Bio-Augmented Fusion, emphasizing 2D local sequence information while selectively incorporating 3D spatial information from predicted structures to complement the sequence space.
